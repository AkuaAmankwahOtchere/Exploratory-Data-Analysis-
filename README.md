# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-

This project focuses on data wrangling. Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data in order to make it suitable for analysis. This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the data wrangling process, including the challenges and techniques involved.
The project begins by introducing the concept of data wrangling and explaining why it is an important step in the data analysis process. It then moves on to explore the challenges that are commonly encountered during the data wrangling process, such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Next, the project delves into the techniques that can be used to overcome these challenges and prepare the data for analysis. These techniques include data cleaning, data transformation, and data normalization. The project includes examples and case studies to illustrate how these techniques can be applied in practice.
The final section of the project presents the results of the data wrangling process, including visualizations and summary statistics that provide insights into the cleaned and transformed data. The project concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings and suggestions for future research in the field of data wrangling.
Overall, this project is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the data wrangling process and how it can be applied to real-world data analysis problems.
